              Hello, I'm Ganga Acharya,
              a passionate web developer with a solid foundation in computer science. I recently graduated from Millersville University with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. My journey through college has equipped me with skills in Java, Python, C/C++, SQL (Postgres), and JavaScript, along with hands-on experience using tools like Git, Gradle, and VS Code. Iâ€™ve worked on exciting projects, including a Python-based UML Editor and a dynamic, responsive blogger website using the MEAN stack. These projects have sharpened my ability to create user-friendly interfaces and integrate robust functionalities.
